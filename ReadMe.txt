This is a discord bot to be used for me and my friends, anyone can use this code but the primary use I have for sharing is so friends can make their own discord bots based on mine...

using the resourceTemplate to import your keys and other information for use in the Discord and Alpha Vantage APIS, used for the discord bot and live stock data resppectively...

!IMPORTANT!
in BOTH DiscordBot.py and stocks.py line one is commented out... feel free to EITHER rename resourceTemplate.py resources OR uncomment line one and comment line 2 once you have added your Discord and Alpha Vantage keys to the appropriate spots in resourceTemplate.py
